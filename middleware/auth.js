// checking authentication status with session on server side
// this helps for routes protection, preventing user from manipulating the web
// page to make changes

// we embed the token into every request (altering forms or sending pages)
// that changes the user's state => this is where csurf comes in; checking
// every request if that token is present (useful against fake sites sending
// requests to my backend, although they have access to my session, their
// request will be missing the csrf token, hence blocked by my server and the
// cool part is that a new token is generated for every new request)

// hence we apply this to our postrequests (which is responsible for data changes)
// since the csurf package will always look for the token in every post 
// request I added a line of code (<input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="<%= csrfToken %>">)
// to every post request body
